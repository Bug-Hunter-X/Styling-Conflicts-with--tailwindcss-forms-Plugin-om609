# Styling Conflicts with @tailwindcss/forms Plugin

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using the `@tailwindcss/forms` plugin in Tailwind CSS.  The plugin's default styles may conflict with custom form element styling or styles from other UI frameworks. The `bug.html` file shows the problem, and the `bugSolution.css` file provides a solution.

## Problem
The default styles of `@tailwindcss/forms` can override your custom styles or conflict with styles applied by other libraries. This might lead to inconsistent or unexpected styling of your form elements.

## Solution
The solution involves using Tailwind's higher specificity selectors to override the plugin's default styles where necessary.  This ensures that your custom styles take precedence.
