The Tailwind CSS plugin `@tailwindcss/forms` might cause unexpected styling issues when using custom form elements or when integrating with other UI frameworks that style form elements differently.  For example, the plugin's default styles might override your custom styles or clash with the styles of another library, leading to inconsistent or broken form element appearance.
